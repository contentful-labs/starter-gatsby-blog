To get you going really quickly this project includes a setup step.

${chalk.yellow.bold('npm run setup')} automates the following steps for you:
  - creates a config file ${chalk.yellow('./.contentful.json')}
  - imports ${chalk.green('a predefined content model')}

When this is done run:

${chalk.yellow(
  'npm run dev'
)} to start a development environment at ${chalk.green('localhost:8000')}

or

${chalk.yellow(
  'npm run build'
)} to create a production ready static site in ${chalk.green('./public')}
