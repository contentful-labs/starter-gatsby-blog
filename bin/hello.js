Thanks for giving the ${pkg.name} a try. ðŸŽ‰
To get you going really quickly this project includes a setup step.

${chalk.yellow.bold("npm run setup")} automates the following steps for you:
  - creates env files ${chalk.yellow("./.env.development")} && ${chalk.yellow("./.env.production")}
  - imports ${chalk.green("a predefined content model")}

When this is done run:

${chalk.yellow(
  "npm run dev"
)} to start a development environment at ${chalk.green("localhost:8000")}

or

${chalk.yellow(
  "npm run build"
)} to create a production ready static site in ${chalk.green("./public")}
